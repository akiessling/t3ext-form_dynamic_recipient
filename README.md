# Form Dynamic Recipient for EXT:form / TYPO3 13.4

This extension adds simple database records, that can be used to generate a select field in the frontend.
The selected option can be accessed with an assigned alias and thus be used as a dynamic recipient, e.g. in the _Recipient address_ field.

Use the old release from `extrameile/form-dynamic-recipient` if you need support for TYPO3 <= 12.4. Further development and support will happen in this repository.

## Installation via composer
```
composer require andreaskiessling/form-dynamic-recipient
```

## Configuration

* Create database records with a label and target email address
* add a select field of type _Selectable recipient_ to the form, configure the page to load the values from and the variable to fill with the selected value: `dynamicRecipient` is preset when adding the field and is not configurable in the form manager, only directly in the YAML file
* New with version 3.x: leave the page field empty in the form yaml to load the recipients from the page with the form plugin
* Configure the _Email to receiver_ finisher with `{dynamicRecipient.email}` and `{dynamicRecipient.label}` - set the form field to required, if you use {dynamicRecipient.email} as the target email address.
